## Separatist spy networks dismantled

National security agencies have uncovered over 1,000 cases of **espionage** and theft of secrets by Taiwan **spies** and have dismantled a number of espionage networks on the Chinese mainland, the Ministry of State Security announced on Tuesday.  

The authorities have also taken resolute actions to promptly thwart the schemes of "Taiwan independence" separatist forces colluding with external powers to provoke disturbances. Those actions have effectively countered foreign interference in the situation across the Taiwan Strait and meddling in Taiwan-related matters, the ministry said.  

It said the authorities have also lawfully punished acts of separatism and "Taiwan independence".  

"Taiwan independence" separatists such as Yang Chih-yuan have been apprehended and investigated, and the enforcement of criminal responsibility against people suspected of promoting separatism has served as a strong deterrent to separatist forces, it said.  

On June 21, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and the Ministry of Justice jointly issued a set of guidelines on imposing criminal penalties on staunch supporters of "Taiwan independence" for engaging in or inciting separatist activities, providing a sound legal basis for punishing separatists.  

Last week, the websites of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and the Ministry of Public Security launched new sections on the lawful punishment of die-hard "Taiwan independence" separatists.
