## Makefile Syntax
A Makefile consists of a set of _rules_. A rule generally looks like this:
``` makefile
targets1: prerequisites
	command
	command
	command

targets2:
	command1
	command2
```
The _targets1_ are file name, separated by spaces. Typically, there is only one per rule.

The _commands_ are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These _need to start with a tab character_, not spaces.

The _prerequisites_ are also file names, separated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called _dependencies_.

each makefile can have more than one target, when run command `make`, the first target will be built by default. You can provider parameter to build target what you want. eg. `make targets2`


## The essence of make
```
blah: blah.c
	cc blah.c -o blah
```
When we run `make` again, the following set of steps happens:
- The first target is selected, because the first target is the default target
- Make decides if it should run the `blah` target. It will only run if `blah` doesn't exist, or `blah.c` is _newer than_ `blah`
- When  depedency `blah.c` is not exist, if target `blah.c` exists, make will run `blah.c` target first. 

## variable
- `$@` 代表当前target。
- `$<` 代表第一个prerequisites。
- `$^` 代表所有prerequisites。
- `$(var)` 访问已定义的变量`var`
