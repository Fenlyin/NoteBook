## Turing Machine
A Turing Machine must satisfy two basic conditions:
1. It must have a go-to (aka. if-else or jump) statement.
2. It must have non-limited memory (Infinitely long tapes).

## Turing Complete
Any language or system that can simulate a Turing Machine is referred to as "Turing Complete".
