| type                   | size(Bytes) | type        | size(Bytes) |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| \[signed] char         | 1           | float       | 4           |
| unsigned char          | 1           | double      | 8           |
| \[signed] int          | 4           | long double | 16          |
| unsigned **\[int]**    | 4           |             |             |
| \[signed] short \[int] | 2           |             |             |
| unsigned short \[int]  | 2           |             |             |
| \[signed] long \[int]  | 8           |             |             |
| unsigned long \[int]   | 8           |             |             |
| **long long \[int]**   | 8           |             |             |

> There are five standard signed integer types : signed char, short int, int, long int, and long long int. In this list, each type provides at least as much storage as those preceding it in the list.

There's also a table 9 in `7.1.6.2 Simple type specifiers`, which shows the "mappings" of the specifiers to actual types (showing that the `int` is optional), a section of which is shown below:

```cpp
Specifier(s)         Type
-------------    -------------
long long int    long long int
long long        long long int
long int         long int
long             long int
```
